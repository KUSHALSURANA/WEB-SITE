    <p><h4><i>Despite its popularity and strong fan following, RCB has yet to win an IPL title, though they have qualified for the playoffs multiple times. The team has featured some of the biggest names in cricket, including Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers, and has been known for its aggressive, often high-scoring approach. </i></h4></p>

    <p><h4><i>RCB's journey in the IPL has been marked by moments of both brilliance and inconsistency, with the team holding records for both the highest and lowest scores in the league. While they've fallen short of winning the title, their consistent presence and passionate fanbase make them a significant force in the IPL landscape.</i></h4></p>
